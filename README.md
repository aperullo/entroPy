# entroPy

entroPy is a collection of types and an interpreter for python based loosely on the
entropy esolang, where values of variables decay as they are used. This is not an
implementation of entropy, but rather a python based language inspired by it. It includes
the same gimmick of variable decay.

## Specific Implementation Choices and Assumptions
Values decay after being read so the first read is always the original value.
